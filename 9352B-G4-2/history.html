                <h1>History</h1>
                <p>The history of gender roles for men and women in the Philippines goes way back during the time when our ancestors lived a traditional life without the influence of the colonials. Back then, men and women shared equal rights and status in the society. In fact, one of their important figures in the past known as the “Babaylan”, is a woman respected for her wisdom and healing abilities. A man disrespecting a woman is unthinkable therefore our ancestors in the past strived together, regardless of gender.</p>
                <p>Then came the Spanish, they influence the idea that women are inferior and therefore must remain in the shadows of men. Their idea of a woman is one who is submissive and someone who stays at home as a good daughter, a wife, and a mother. Rights for education, politics, and freedom of women during the Spanish era were harshly suppressed. It was a dark time for gender equality. Nonetheless, many historical women rose in the Spanish era. Two of them are Gabriela Silang and Gregoria de Jesus. Both of them showed that even women can rush in the midst of battle alongside men.</p>

                <p><b class ="name">Gabriela Silang (María Josefa Gabriela Cariño Silang)</b> is a prominent figure known as the “Philippines’ Joan of Arc”. She is the wife of Diego Silang who bravely led the war after his husband’s death.</p>

                <p><b class ="name">Gregoria de Jesus </b>is someone who fought bravely alongside his husband, Andres Bonifacio, and the members of the Katipunan.</p>
                <p>After the Spanish era came the Americans. In this era, the idea of gender equality are slowly returning to the Filipinos. Mem and women are given equal rights to education and political power. They were given freedom to choose their paths just like men. </p>

                </figure>
                
                <p>One of the prominent figures in this era is <b class ="name">Dr. Fe Del Mundo</b>. She is the first female to graduate in Harvard School of Medicine. She proved that women are not just meant to be inside the house, they can do things that man can, if only given the proper right and the freedom to do so.</p>
                <p>In today’s era, gender equality is improving as time ages. Laws are implemented to protect both men and women’s freedom and rights. Though gender equality are still lacking in some aspects, we believe that with proper dissemination of information to the society, there will come a time when gender equality will be a subject both accepted and embraced. Because before we were colonized, we Filipinos were first and foremost a great example of a society with equal rights regardless of gender.</p>

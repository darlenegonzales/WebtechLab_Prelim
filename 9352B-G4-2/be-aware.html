                <h1>Be Aware</h1>
                <p>According to the data we accumulated by interviewing the barangay officials of Bakakeng Norte, Baguio City; 7 out of 10 of their staff composed of women, excluded of the barangay Tanods. Most of the Tanods are composed of men. According to them, some women also joins the workforce of the barangay Tanod. There was also a time when the chief barangay Tanod was a woman. The officials treat their co-workers equally regardless of gender. They said that in terms of efficiency, all of the officials are equally hardworking and dependable on their task. This proves that gender equality are slowly improving.</p>
                <p><q>We are children of Gabriela</q> said one of the female barangay official.  The barangay aims to promote gender equality by organizing projects and seminars to the citizens of the barangay.</p>
                <p><q>We believe that education is the key. We need to wash out the old ideals that men are superior to women. God sees us equally, it’s time we think the same to our friends.</q> said one of the barangay official.</p>
                <p>Though the supporters of gender equality are increasing, some are still stuck in the old ideals. When we asked an anonymous repairman about his opinion for a woman doing repair work, he said “How can a woman wearing dress and frizzy clothes could work as a repairman?” In contrast to his opinion, women can do a man’s work and at the same time men can also do a women’s work. </p>
                <p>Here are some notable men and women who proved that ability is not dependent on gender. </p>

                <p>Gender equality entails that everyone has the freedom to be anyone with proper commitment and hard work.</p>

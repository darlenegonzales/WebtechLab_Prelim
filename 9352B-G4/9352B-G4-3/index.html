                The Earth is the only planet we humans can call home, and as far as we know this is the only planet that can sustain life. Every day is a constant struggle for the planet to keep up with our modern lifestyle. We humans who have been utilizing and misusing nature’s resources and benefitting from it must also learn to protect it and nurture it. Our advocacy leans towards eco-friendly projects and acts of reducing wastes and other resources that might pose a threat to the environment and human health. We promote recycling and proper garbage disposal in accordance to RA 6969 (Republic Act 6969 Toxic Substances, Hazardous and Nuclear Waste Control Act of 1990).

                <p>According to the interview conducted from the Barangay officials in Bakakeng Norte, one of the aforementioned problems concerning the environment is that some households do not segregate their garbage, this can be a handful especially for the garbage collectors who have to sort out the garbage beforehand. The garbage disposal schedule is not being followed by some residents and at in some days’ garbage collection tend to be late.  Littering is also another issue that was mentioned by the interviewed officials. On a minor scale one of the issues that was raised by one of the officials is the burning of garbage that occurs occasionally on some houses, this can pose a dangerous threat to resident’s health if inhaled and should be stopped and condoned.</p>

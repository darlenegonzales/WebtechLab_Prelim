                <h2><b>Be Aware</b></h2>
                <p>According to the interview conducted from the Barangay officials in Bakakeng Norte, one of the aforementioned problems concerning the environment is that some households do not segregate their garbage, this can be a handful especially for the garbage collectors who have to sort out the garbage beforehand. The garbage disposal schedule is not being followed by some residents and at in some days’ garbage collection tend to be late.  Littering is also another issue that was mentioned by the interviewed officials. On a minor scale one of the issues that was raised by one of the officials is the burning of garbage that occurs occasionally on some houses, this can pose a dangerous threat to resident’s health if inhaled and should be stopped and condoned.</p>
				<p>Another concern from an interviewed resident of Bakakeng Norte is that students have the highest tendency to litter and scatter their trash, which is unsightly for other residents who has stayed longer in the barangay.</p>

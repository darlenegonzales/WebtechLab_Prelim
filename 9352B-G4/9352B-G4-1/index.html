                <h2><b>Be Aware</b></h2>
                <p>To know the opinion of the people of Barangay Bakakeng Norte in Baguio City regarding religious tolerance, we interview Ma’am _______, one of the Brgy. Officials. According to her, their barangay is composed of people who belong to the different religious groups, namely Roman Catholic, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Pentecostal, Methodist, Muslim and Iglesia Ni Cristo. Records clearly shows that people on their barangay are relatively peaceful and respectful for there are no issues consulted to them regarding religious conflicts or misunderstanding. She also said that people in their community are allowed practice their way of worship just like going house to house to share and not to enforce their belief to others. Ma’am ___ also related that they themselves who work in the Barangay hall belong to different groups yet they maintain their peace and work in unity because they respect what their fellow worker believe in. She believes that religious tolerance includes “respecting the principles of others.”</p>

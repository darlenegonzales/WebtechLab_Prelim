                <h2><b>Be Aware</b></h2>
                <p>To know the opinion of the people of Barangay Bakakeng Norte in Baguio City regarding religious tolerance, we interview Ma’am Haggerty, one of the Brgy. Officials. According to her, their barangay is composed of people who belong to the different religious groups, namely Roman Catholic, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Pentecostal, Methodist, Muslim and Iglesia Ni Cristo. Records clearly shows that people on their barangay are relatively peaceful and respectful for there are no issues consulted to them regarding religious conflicts or misunderstanding. She also said that people in their community are allowed practice their way of worship just like going house to house to share and not to enforce their belief to others. Ma’am Haggerty also related that they themselves who work in the Barangay hall belong to different groups yet they maintain their peace and work in unity because they respect what their fellow worker believe in. She believes that religious tolerance includes <q class="blue-quote">respecting the principles of others.</q></p>

                <p>Religious tolerance all starts from you. Here are some ways that you can promote the advocacy.</p>
                <ol class = "involvement">
                    <li>Respect others. There is no necessity to convert others to being a clone of you.</li>
                    <li>Allow all others the same independence whether you disagree with or dislike their positions.</li>
                    <li>Appreciate and learn from differences without losing your own. Difference makes life interesting and living worthwhile. The best relationships and the best societies are the ones where differences thrive.  </li>
                    <li>Never force someone to believe what you believe. Respect their preferences based on their religion.</li>
